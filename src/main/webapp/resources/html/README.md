# Hyper - Responsive Admin Template & UI Kit
We would like to thank you for purchasing Hyper :). The following guideline will help you to get started with the hyper and its documentation.

#### Webpack
With 2.0 release, we have provided the `webpack` based version as well. In order to get started with it, please take a look at either `read me` file or `docs/index.html` inside `webpack` folder. We highly recommended to use webpack based version if you are just starting with Hyper. Though existing users of hyper can continue using the gulp based build flow.

#### React
With 2.0 release, we have also provided the `react` based version as well. In order to get started with it, please take a look at either `read me` file or `docs/index.html` inside `react` folder.  

#### Docs and Examples

The `docs` directory contains all the static resources required for docs and examples. To view, just open in your favorite browser!

```
$ open docs/index.html
```
Once you open the documentation. Just click on `Getting Started` link from left, this would open up the page (`docs/getting-started.html`) containing instructions to get started with setup. Optionally, you can review quick setup guide described below.

#### Gulp

We've included Gulp file (gulpfile.js) to help you get started with the theme and build automation. You'll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js. Note that the detailed instructions are available in `docs/index.html` too.

To install Node visit [https://nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download/).

To install gulp, run the following command:

```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

When you're done, install the rest of the theme's dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

From here on out, simply run `gulp` from your terminal and you're good to go!

+ `gulp` - Recompiles and minifies theme assets into `dist` directory and starts the local server serving the theme.
